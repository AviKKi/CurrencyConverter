# React Native CurrencyConverter (LearnCodeOnline's assignment)
As request by some I'm uploading the sourcecode of the app, the most interesting part(besides the cool look ;) is fetching currency rates from API
you can find it in [componentWillMount method of App class](https://github.com/AviKKi/CurrencyConverter/blob/master/App.js).
